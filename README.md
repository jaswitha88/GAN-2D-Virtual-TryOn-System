 A GAN-Based 2D Virtual Clothing Try-On System
Using Pose Estimation and Semantic Segmentation

 Project Overview
This project implements a GAN-based 2D virtual clothing try-on system that allows users to visualize garments on a person image without physically wearing them.

The system integrates:
- Pose Estimation
- Semantic Segmentation
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

 Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
  Working Pipeline
1. Input person image
2. Pose estimation extraction
3. Human segmentation
4. Cloth alignment
5. GAN-based synthesis
6. Final try-on image generation

  How to Run

python ttt.py --name testname
